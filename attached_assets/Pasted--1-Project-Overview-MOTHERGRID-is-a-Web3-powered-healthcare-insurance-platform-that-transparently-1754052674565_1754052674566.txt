📌 1. Project Overview
MOTHERGRID is a Web3-powered healthcare-insurance platform that transparently tracks a mother’s maternity journey—checkups, hospitalizations, tests, and insurance interactions—using blockchain smart contracts. It eliminates paperwork, reduces fraud, empowers low-literacy users, and improves insurer-provider-patient trust.

💡 2. Problem Statement
Traditional health insurance systems are:

Opaque – No shared visibility between patients, providers, and insurers.

Cumbersome – Rely on manual documentation, causing delays.

Fraud-prone – Difficult to verify claims accurately.

Inaccessible – Especially for low-literacy populations.

🎯 3. Solution
A blockchain-powered claim lifecycle system:

Logs every medical event as a smart contract transaction.

Automates insurance eligibility, claims, reimbursements.

Empowers users with a visual claim timeline dashboard.

Ensures compliance, traceability, and data integrity.

🧱 4. Architecture
🔗 Tech Stack:
Blockchain: Ethereum / Hyperledger Fabric (smart contract engine)

Frontend: React.js + Tailwind CSS (visual dashboards)

Backend: Node.js + Express + MongoDB

AI Modules: Python (LLMs, NLP), HuggingFace Transformers

Integrations: IPFS (document storage), IoT (wearables), Firebase (auth)

📊 System Components:
Smart Contract Engine

Manages event recording, eligibility rules, payment triggers.

Claim Lifecycle Manager

Tracks stages: submission → review → approval → payout.

User Dashboard

Shows coverage, claim status, and history (with icons & color codes).

AI Utilities

Policy Navigator Bot

Clause Conflict Detector

Dynamic Coverage Simulator

Regulatory Compliance Checker

Explainable AI Visualizer

👥 5. Target Users
Mothers (especially in rural/low-literacy areas)

Insurers

Healthcare Providers

Regulators

🔄 6. Workflow Example
Checkup logged → Smart contract updates timeline

Claim triggered → Auto-verification via IoT (e.g., vitals)

AI module flags non-compliant clauses

Dashboard visualizes real-time claim progress

Insurer approves claim → Reimbursement processed

🧪 7. Innovative Features
🔐 Smart Contracts for automatic and tamper-proof transactions

🧠 LLMs for legal text translation and clause analysis

📱 Visual UX for users with limited literacy

🔄 IoT Integration for real-time validation

🧰 Explainable AI for transparent decision reasoning

📊 8. Evaluation Metrics
Metric	Goal
Claim Processing Time	↓ 70%
User Literacy Requirement	↓ Simplified (icon-based)
Fraud Rate	↓ 80%
Compliance Accuracy	↑ 95%
User Satisfaction	> 4.5/5

🔄 9. Scalability Plan
Phase 1: Maternity claims (pilot)

Phase 2: Childcare & emergency insurance

Phase 3: Nationwide roll-out with multilingual support
